This project is a custom featured found by me to send custom messages by E-mail and SMS using the Google Calendar Reminders Feature.

The idea is to set an event to start after 1 h and 15 min of the event you want to alert the administrator. Then, set the reminder to 1 hour before the event. So the diffeeerence will be the time you will receive the Alert. In this case 15 min after the event was tiggered. 

It uses gdata API from google.

It's important to notice that it only works with the main calendar owned by the user (e-mail) passed as parameter.
It's important also to register your cellphone number with the Google Calendar, by using its settings. Otherwise you won't receive the SMS.
